### Deploying to Vercel

This project is configured for deployment to Vercel. Follow these steps:

1. Create a PostgreSQL database (using Vercel Postgres, Supabase, Neon, etc.)
2. Install the Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
3. Link your project: `vercel link`
4. Add the following environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:
   - `DATABASE_CLIENT=postgres`
   - `DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_connection_string`
   - `DATABASE_SSL=true`
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - `APP_KEYS` (Generate random keys)
   - `API_TOKEN_SALT` (Generate a random salt)
   - `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET` (Generate a random secret)
   - `JWT_SECRET` (Generate a random secret)
   - `TRANSFER_TOKEN_SALT` (Generate a random salt)
5. Deploy your project: `vercel --prod`

Note: For production, you should use a proper PostgreSQL database as SQLite is not suitable for Vercel's serverless environment.

```
yarn strapi deploy
```
